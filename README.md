# credit_card_fraud_detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using four different classification algorithms.

## Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical issue for banks and financial institutions. The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms.

We have implemented the following algorithms to perform fraud detection:

### Logistic Regression
### Random Forest Classifier
### Decision Tree Classifier
### Naive Bayes Classifier
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions compared to non-fraudulent ones.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

# Algorithms Used
# 1. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a simple linear model used to predict binary outcomes (fraud vs. non-fraud). It estimates the probability of an event occurring based on the input features.

# 2. Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make a final prediction. This helps improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

# 3. Decision Tree Classifier
A Decision Tree is a model that splits data into smaller subsets based on the most important features, creating a tree of decisions.

# 4. Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between features, making it a fast and efficient algorithm.
